## Serialization Tools

- [Sitecore command line Interface (CLI)](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/100/developer-tools/sitecore-command-line-interface.html)
- [Sitecore for Visual Studio](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/100/developer-tools/sitecore-for-visual-studio.html)

**Content Serialization** converts items to **text files**.

You can use these text files to transfer to **another database** or to a **Sitecore solution**.

Serialization makes pushing and pulling Sitecore items in and out of their solutions incredibly efficient.

You need to configure **modules**, sets of **includes and rules** that determine what you want to serialize and how you want to interact with things you pull and push in your solution.

To do it, Sitecore offer two tools:

[Sitecore command line Interface (CLI)](3_commandLineInterface.md) and [Sitecore for Visual Studio](4_sitecoreForVisualStudio.md).
