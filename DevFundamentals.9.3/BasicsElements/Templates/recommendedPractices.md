## Recommended practices

- Create a new template only when you need to create an item which:
  - requires fields **not defined** in existing data templates.
  - requires unique default values and default settings.
- Naming convention
  - simple, relevant and easy to understand named for templates, fields and sections.
  - names are displayed to technical and non technical users.
  - select names that business users, such as Content Authors, will easily recognize and understand.
- Folder structure
  - provide a clear folder structure that classifies by website, site section, section content, function, and so on.
  - a proper folder structure to make it easier to navigate and find a given template.
- Field names
  - you should not reuse a same field name within the same template.
  - be careful not to have two fields with the same name in the inheritance chain either.
- Use icons to identify templates
