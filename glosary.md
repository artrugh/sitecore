## Pipelines

In software development, a **deployment pipeline** is a **system of automated processes** designed to quickly and accurately move new code additions and updates from version control to production.

In past development environments, manual steps were necessary when writing, building, and deploying code.

[more about pipelines, continuos integration (CI) and continuos delevery (CD)](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-cicd-pipeline#:~:text=A%20CI%2FCD%20pipeline%20is,reliability%20engineering%20(SRE)%20approach.)

## Scaffolding

**Scaffolding** is a technique supported by some **model–view–controller frameworks**, in which the programmer can specify how the application database may be used.

The compiler or framework uses this specification, together with pre-defined code templates, to generate the final code that the application can use to create, read, update and delete database entries, effectively treating the templates as a "scaffold" on which to build a more powerful application.

## On-premises Software

**On-premises software** is a software installed and runs on computers on the **premises of the person or organization using the software**, rather than at a remote facility such as a server farm or cloud. On-premises software is sometimes referred to as "shrinkwrap" software, and off-premises software is commonly called "software as a service" ("SaaS") or "cloud computing".

## Reverse proxy

A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server.

A reverse proxy provides an additional level of abstraction and control to ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and servers.

## Loopback

The **local loopback** mechanism may be used to run a network service on a host without requiring a physical network interface, or without making the service accessible from the networks the computer may be connected to. For example, a locally installed website may be accessed from a Web browser by the URL http://localhost to display its home page.

The name localhost normally resolves to the IPv4 loopback address 127.0.0.1, and to the IPv6 loopback address.

## Solr

Solr is an **open-source enterprise-search platform**, written in Java.

Its major features include:
- full-text search
- hit highlighting
- faceted search
- real-time indexing
- dynamic clustering
- database integration
- NoSQL features
- rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. 

Providing distributed search and index replication, Solr is designed for scalability and fault tolerance.Solr is widely used for enterprise search and analytics use cases and has an active development community and regular releases.

## Enterprise search

**Enterprise search** is the practice of making content from multiple enterprise-type sources, such as databases and intranets, searchable to a defined audience.

It is used to describe the software of search information within an enterprise (though the search function and its results may still be public). Enterprise search can be contrasted with **web search**, which applies search technology to documents on the open web, and **desktop search**, which applies search technology to the content on a single computer.

Enterprise search systems **index data and documents** from a variety of sources such as: file systems, intranets, document management systems, e-mail, and databases.

Many enterprise search systems integrate structured and unstructured data in their collections. Enterprise search systems also use access controls to enforce a security policy on their users.

## Faceted search

**Faceted search** is a technique that involves augmenting traditional search techniques with a faceted navigation system, allowing users to narrow down search results by applying multiple filters based on faceted classification of the items.

## Transort Layer Security

The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide cryptography, including privacy (confidentiality), integrity, and authenticity through the use of certificates, between two or more communicating computer applications. It runs in the application layer and is itself composed of two layers: the TLS record and the TLS handshake protocols.

## Load balancer

A **load balancer** is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers.

Load balancers are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability of applications. They improve the overall performance of applications by decreasing the burden on servers associated with managing and maintaining application and network sessions, as well as by performing application-specific tasks.

## Ps1 file extension

A ps1 file is a script, or **cmdlet**, executed by Windows PowerShell. They are used to **automate Windows tasks*.

## Development overhead

Project Overhead refers to the costs of a project that a company incurs indirectly – also called indirect costs. These expenses cannot be directly attributed to one project, but instead are costs related to running the company and therefore apply to all projects the company completes.
