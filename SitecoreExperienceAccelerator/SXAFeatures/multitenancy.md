## Tenant

Sitecore Experience Platform requires custom development to support the creation of tenants and websites.

However with SXA you have the option to quickly create tenants and sites.

A tenant is an independent group of sites with it owns set of templates and media items.

A tenant often represents a brand and can include any number of related websites. It is the equivalent of a business unit.

The websites within a Tenant are aligned to share a single Sitecore instance but are different enough to require their own data structure.

Example:
- Single brand host websites in different tenants, based on geographical region.
- Single brand has one tenant with multiple sites grouped into their respective site folders for supporting local markets.

Tenant has autonomy to manage their own sites, channels, and data.

A site is a collection of content and output with a common overall business objective that shares a common set of assets.

Tenants can also share resources with other tenants.
