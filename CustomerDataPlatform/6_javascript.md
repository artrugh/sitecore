### JavaScript

#### Client Side JavaScript

A marketer can apply the **Client Side JavaScript** by adding a web template, or a programmer can write the **Client Side JavaScript** themselves.

- Run a **web experience** based on conditions that relates to the page that the guest is visiting.

- Enable Sitecore Personalize to access browser data, including the Document Object Model (DOM) from the browser. This enables you to manipulate the structure, style, and content of the experiment, including where and how you want the offer or content to display in the browser.

#### Server Side JavaScript

It enables back-end access to systems, services and servers. This means you can use **guest attributes and their history**, as well as a continuous stream of real-time session data. The internal **Guest Context Service** generates the guest attributes on the server-side.

**Sitecore Personalize** can run server-side JavaScript when:

- running **programmable decisions** in Sitecore Personalize decisioning. A programmable decision is the component on the decision palette that you can click and drag into the decision canvas to apply JavaScript.
- generating **real-time audiences** in experiments.
