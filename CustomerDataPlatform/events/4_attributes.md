#### Point of Sale

A Point of Sale (POS) is a specific storefront for which your organization sells products. There are many advantages to setting up a POS. You must be assigned an **Enterprise User Manager** or **Enterprise Admin** role in Sitecore Personalize to manage a POS.

| Name | enter a name for the POS, such as myretailsite.co.uk. |

#### Browser Id

CDP assigns to every user of your application a **Browser ID**. It associates sessions, events, and orders with the respective user.

Every event that you send to Sitecore CDP must include the Browser ID. This ensures that the correct session, event, and order data is associated with the correct user.

- Client-Side
    Boxever JavaScript Library automatically creates the browser ID. Then, the web browser stores the browser ID as a **first-party cookie**. The cookie is persisted until it expires or gets deleted. When you send an event to CDP, you must include the browser ID in the event object.

    ```JavaScript
    Boxever.getID();
    ```

- Server-side
    Using direct HTTP requests, you must manually request a browser ID first. To do this, you make a GET request to the Browser API (Stream API type). The response includes the browser ID. When you send an event to Sitecore CDP, for example, a VIEW event, you must include the browser ID in the event object.

    ```C
    curl -X GET -g 'https://api.boxever.com/v1.2/browser/create.json?client_key=psfu6uh05hsr9c34rptlr06dn864cqrx'
    ```
    response
    ```JSON
    {   
        "status":"OK",
        "version":"1.2",
        "client_key":"psfu6uh05hsr9c34rptlr06dn864cqrx",
        "ref":"d324a895-72b8-458b-84ad-2090494fd79a",
        "customer_ref":"0f6f4713-ac7d-4858-8d22-01d246736d03"
    }
    ```
